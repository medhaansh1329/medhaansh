        and we were there on discord from morning 8 to raat
        ke 2 baje. We talked for some 12 hrs and never realised that we talked for that much time, whenever i was with you it felt like time didnt exist untill I actually saw the time and realised it was 2 😂😂😂😂. I never got bored of you.
        <br><br>We got to know about almost every detail about our lives and literally knew everything abt each other, given any second of the day I would know where Medhavi was is how close i got to you. We used to tell each other everything about
        our lives immediately and were the first to know about everything about each other. I didnt even know two people can get that close. There is so much i can tell about this year but some stand out the most. If i had to make higlight on this
        year then everysecond of this year would be in this year 😂😂😂.
